# cyclic-rotation
This is Java 8 implementation to rotate data in an array. It means each element in array is shifted right by the given number.

The goal of this algorithm is to shift right the array A elements by K times. K is an integer.

Example:
    
Program inputs:

    A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    K = 3

Output should be : {2, 3, 4, 1}
